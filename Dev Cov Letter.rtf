\f0\fs24 \cf0 Hi! My name is Jordan Adkins and I\'92m interested in becoming a future employee! If you want to know what I can do go here: https://davos-57f96.web.app.\

I have been working on this for about two months during my free time. It is built using React.js, Node.js and NPM, Tailwind CSS for styling, Google Maps, and Google Firebase (Firestore Database, Authentication, Cloud Storage, reCAPTCHA, and Hosting) for the backend. It is a fully operational, however, it is still a work in progress.\
\
Things I plan on implementing in the future: 1) Utilizing the Geoapify Platform to provide location services for the application. 2) Building a separate shop for merchandise sales. I am leaning towards using Stripe for payment processing. 3) Eventually turning the whole app into a social media outlet where members are able to network and like-minded entrepreneurs can connect and create.}
